write_up:
  - paragraph: "Edwin Mak (pronouns he/him/his) is a technical leader for the DiaperBase project. His main responsibility as a technical leader is to drive impact changes through guiding strategic technical solutions that address the problems faced by diaper project stakeholders. Through this he aims to deliver highly impactful software solutions that nonprofits can use to deliver more positivity into the world."
  - paragraph: "He brings with him over six years of software development and startup experience to Ruby for Good. He currently works as the Lead Software Engineer at a communication company, Lingo Live, which aims to promote better communication in the workplace. Prior to that, his first software job was with an emerging food delivery company in New York City. In that position, he coded in the daytime hours and tested his software at night by making real food deliveries using the application they had built. (Ask him about the time he delivered 15 mason jars of soup in one of the worst blizzards in NYC history!) Before software development, Edwin worked on developing surgical devices in a collaboration with the City College of New York and the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center."
