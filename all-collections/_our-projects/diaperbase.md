DiaperBase began as a solution for one diaper bank in Portland, and has since grown to serve over 100 nonprofits around the country, including diaper banks, period supply organizations, food banks, and others.
DiaperBase, along with its partner app, PartnerBase (created in 2018),  that enables partner organizations to place orders and collect distributions, was conceptualized, designed, and built entirely by Ruby for Good volunteers."
